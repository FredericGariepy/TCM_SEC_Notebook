'''
At the lowest level, we have machine code which is just 1s and 0s.
Next, level up is Assembly. A low level programing language. 
Works directly with registers and interupts.
Each line (usually) translate to one processor intruction.
Diffrent processors use different assemby code.

# SysCalls
Every native API call has a specific syscall number
Move the number into -> registers ->  in x64 the syscall intruction will enter kernel mode

LETS ALLOCATE MEMORY WITH SYSCALLS AND AVOID THE WIN32 API (KERNEL32 and NT)
